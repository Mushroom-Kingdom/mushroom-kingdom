## Description
        
The Mushroom Kingdom was designed with one of the developers, Nick Pasch, in mind. It was designed so that it could be used as a shop for him after the project, as it completely mimics one now. It features a home page with relevant information, an about page for people who want to learn more about what the mushroom kingdom is, a shop page for a list of mushrooms that operates with a database and an order page for signed in users to order mushrooms. There is also hidden admin functionality if you type /admin in the URL, where you can add and edit mushrooms in the database from the admin dashboard. 

## Installation 

Just go to the website which is deployed on heroku! 

## Usage

Everyone is invited to view the website but if users require the order page, then they must make an account! 

## License

This application is covered under the MIT license. 

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome to improve the mushroom kingdom! 

## Tests
